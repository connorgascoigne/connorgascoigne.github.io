I am an Research Associate at [MRC Center for Environment and Health](https://environment-health.ac.uk/) at Imperial College, London, working on developing spatio-temporal Bayesian frameworks for modelling the effects of policy on health. I am currently working within the [Epidemiology and Biostatistics Department](https://sites.google.com/view/envstats/home) headed by Professor [Marta Blangiardo](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.blangiardo).

I have a PhD in Statistics awarded from the [Mathematical Sciences department](https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-mathematical-sciences/) at the University of Bath. My PhD was titled "[Modelling of spatio-temporal disease rates using age-period-cohort methods](../files/PhDThesis_Gascoigne.pdf)" and I was supervised by Doctor [Theresa Smith](https://people.bath.ac.uk/trs35/). During my PhD, I developed subnational under-five and neonatal mortality estimates for low-and-middle income countries and contributed to the [UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimates(UNIGME) Estimates](https://childmortality.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/UN-IGME_Subnational_U5MR_and_NMR_2000-2021-1.pdf). Prior to my PhD, I was completed an MMath at the University of Leicester.
