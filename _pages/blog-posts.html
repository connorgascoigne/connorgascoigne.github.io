<p class="wordwrap">Normally I spend my days sourcing and downloading different datasets, and then I spend a considerable, <i>and completely necessary</i>, amount of time working out nice ways to present it. Whilst I like to convince myself and everyone around me this is an extremely useful and necessary part of my job, I appreciate others may see different.</p>

<p class="wordwrap">So, to save someone else the hassle, and help me be far more productive in their job than I am in mine, I decided to write a few blog posts, <i>which again is completely necessary</i>, going over where to find the data and how to process and present.</p>

<p class="wordwrap">Just an FYI, I have a bit of a thing for making all my plots into either some kind of heatmap or map, so expect to see a few of these along the wayâ€¦ Happy reading!
