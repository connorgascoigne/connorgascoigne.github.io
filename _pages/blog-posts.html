<div class="wordwrap">Normally I spend my days sourcing and downloading different datasets, and then I spend an <i>completely necessary<\i> amount of time wokring out nice ways to present them. Whilst I do enjoy this part of the job, it can be a killer and take far to long... So I thought I would, hopefully, save someone time by having a collection of posts about where I find the data and how I have gone about presenting them. Just an FYI, maps and heatplots are my favorite kind of plots, so they may appear frequently... Happy reading!</div>

{% include base_path %}
{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
