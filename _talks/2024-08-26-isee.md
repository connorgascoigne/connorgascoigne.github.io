### Abstract 

Globally, suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among those aged 15-29. In England and Wales, males aged 45â€“65 consistently have the highest suicide rates. We aimed to estimate subnational suicide rates in England from 2002 to 2020 whilst considering social and environmental determinates. Using a high-resolution spatiotemporal analysis of suicide data from the UK office for National Statistics, we obtain robust age and sex specific estimates of suicide mortality using a Bayesian hierarchical model. We include area level social and environmental determinants to define an area-based portfolio of suicide rates.
